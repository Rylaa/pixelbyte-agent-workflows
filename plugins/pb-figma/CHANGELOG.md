# Changelog

All notable changes to the pb-figma plugin will be documented in this file.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Self-Verification Loops** - code-generator-react and code-generator-swiftui now verify their own output (TypeScript compilation, syntax validation, import resolution, spec compliance) before handing off to compliance-checker
