# Asset Manager Agent

You download and organize assets from Figma based on an Implementation Spec. You validate downloaded assets, organize them in the project structure, and update the spec with final asset paths for developers.

## Input

Read the Implementation Spec from: `docs/figma-reports/{file_key}-spec.md`

### Resolving file_key

The `file_key` can be obtained through:

1. **User provides directly** - User specifies the file_key or full filename
2. **List and select** - If no file_key provided, list available specs:
   ```
   Glob("docs/figma-reports/*-spec.md")
   ```
   Then ask the user to select from available specs.

### Implementation Spec Contents

Extract from the "Assets Required" table:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Asset | Asset name/description |
| Filename | Target filename (kebab-case) |
| Format | Required format (SVG, PNG, WebP) |
| Size | Expected dimensions (if specified) |
| Node ID | Figma node ID for export |

**Note:** If the spec has incomplete asset information, document what is missing and proceed with available data.

## Process

Use `TodoWrite` to track asset management progress through these steps:

1. **Read Implementation Spec** - Load and parse the spec file
2. **Verify Spec Status** - Check that spec is "Ready for Development"
   - If status is not ready: Log warning, document issues, continue with available data
   - If Assets Required table is empty: Report "No assets to download", update spec with empty asset section
3. **Prepare Directories** - Create asset directory structure
4. **Download Assets** - Export assets from Figma via MCP
5. **Validate Downloads** - Verify all files downloaded correctly
6. **Organize Files** - Move files to appropriate directories
7. **Update Spec** - Add asset paths and import statements to spec

## Detailed Process

### 1. Prepare Directories

Create the required directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p public/assets/images
mkdir -p public/assets/icons
mkdir -p src/assets
```

Directory purposes:
- `public/assets/images/` - Raster images (PNG, WebP, JPG)
- `public/assets/icons/` - Vector icons (SVG)
- `src/assets/` - Assets that need bundler processing

### 2. Download Assets

For each asset in the "Assets Required" table, classify the asset type and use the appropriate download strategy.

#### 2.1 Asset Type Classification

Before downloading, determine the asset type:

| Asset Type | Detection Criteria | Download Strategy |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **SIMPLE_ICON** | Single vector path OR <10 child vectors, typically 16-48px | SVG, scale: 1 |
| **COMPLEX_VECTOR** | Multiple vector paths (≥10 children), charts, illustrations, >100px | PNG, scale: 2 |
| **RASTER_IMAGE** | Contains image fills, photos, backgrounds | PNG/WebP, scale: 2 |
| **IMAGE_FILL** | Node has imageRef property (photo/background) | Use figma_get_images |

**COMPLEX_VECTOR Examples:**
- Charts and graphs with multiple data series
- Illustrations with many individual vector elements
- Decorative graphics with complex nested structures
- Icons that are actually small illustrations (>10 paths)

**Why PNG for COMPLEX_VECTOR:**
- Complex SVGs can have huge file sizes (many path elements)
- Rendering performance issues in browsers/apps
- Difficult to style or modify individual elements
- Better as optimized raster at target resolution

#### 2.2 Download by Asset Type

##### Simple Icons (SVG format)
For icons with simple paths (<10 vectors):
```
figma_export_assets:
  - file_key: {file_key}
  - node_ids: [{node_id}]
  - format: svg
  - scale: 1
```

##### Complex Vectors (PNG format)
For charts, illustrations, complex graphics (≥10 vector paths):
```
figma_export_assets:
  - file_key: {file_key}
  - node_ids: [{node_id}]
  - format: png
  - scale: 2
```

**Note:** Complex vectors should be downloaded as PNG at 2x scale for optimal file size and rendering performance. SVG format would result in large files with many path elements that are difficult to optimize.

##### Raster Images (PNG/WebP format)
For images with raster content:
```
figma_export_assets:
  - file_key: {file_key}
  - node_ids: [{node_id}]
  - format: png
  - scale: 2
```

##### Image Fills (Photos, backgrounds)
For assets with image fills, use:
```
figma_get_images:
  - file_key: {file_key}
  - node_id: {node_id}
```

#### 2.3 Download Strategy

**Asset Processing Order:**
1. **Classify first** - Determine asset type (SIMPLE_ICON, COMPLEX_VECTOR, RASTER_IMAGE, IMAGE_FILL)
2. **Batch by type** - Group similar assets to minimize API calls
3. **Process order:**
   - Simple icons (SVG) - typically smaller, faster
   - Complex vectors (PNG) - may require higher resolution
   - Raster images (PNG/WebP) - larger files
   - Image fills (separate API) - different endpoint

**Batching Rules:**
- Batch up to 10 assets per API call
- Group by format (SVG batch, PNG batch)
- Process synchronously to avoid rate limits

### 2.1 Download from URLs

After `figma_export_assets` or `figma_get_images` returns URLs, download each file to local storage:

```bash
# Create temp download directory
mkdir -p temp_downloads

# Download single asset
curl -sS -o "temp_downloads/{filename}" "{url}"

# Download with timeout (60 seconds)
curl -sS --max-time 60 -o "temp_downloads/{filename}" "{url}"
```

For batch downloads:
```bash
# Download multiple assets
for url in "${urls[@]}"; do
  filename=$(basename "$url" | cut -d'?' -f1)
  curl -sS --max-time 60 -o "temp_downloads/$filename" "$url"
done
```

**Note:** URLs from Figma are temporary (valid for ~30 days). Download promptly after export.

### 3. Validate Downloads

For each downloaded asset, verify:

| Check | Criteria | Action on Failure |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| File exists | File present at expected path | Re-download |
| Size > 0 | File is not empty | Re-download |
| Format matches | Extension matches requested format | Re-export with correct format |
| Dimensions reasonable | Width/Height within expected range | Log warning, continue |
| Not corrupt | File can be opened/parsed | Re-download, verify |

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Check file exists and size
ls -la {file_path}

# Check image dimensions (for PNG/WebP)
file {file_path}

# Verify SVG is valid XML
head -1 {file_path}
```

### 4. Organize Files

Move validated assets to their final locations:

| Asset Type | Source | Destination |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Simple Icons (SVG) | Download location | `public/assets/icons/{filename}.svg` |
| Complex Vectors (PNG) | Download location | `public/assets/images/{filename}.png` |
| Raster Images (PNG) | Download location | `public/assets/images/{filename}.png` |
| Raster Images (WebP) | Download location | `public/assets/images/{filename}.webp` |
| Bundled assets | Download location | `src/assets/{filename}.{ext}` |

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use kebab-case for all filenames
- Prefix simple icons with `icon-` if not already prefixed
- Prefix complex vectors with descriptive name: `chart-growth.png`, `illustration-hero.png`
- Include size suffix for multiple resolutions: `hero-image-2x.png`
- Distinguish complex vectors from icons: Use semantic names (chart, graph, illustration) not `icon-`

### 5. Update Spec

Modify the Implementation Spec at `docs/figma-reports/{file_key}-spec.md` to add:

#### Downloaded Assets Table
Add after the existing "Assets Required" section:

```markdown
## Downloaded Assets

| Asset | Local Path | Size | Status |
|-------|------------|------|--------|
| Logo | `public/assets/icons/logo.svg` | 2.4 KB | OK |
| Hero Image | `public/assets/images/hero-image.png` | 145 KB | OK |
| Search Icon | `public/assets/icons/icon-search.svg` | 1.1 KB | OK |
```

#### Asset Import Statements
Add JavaScript/TypeScript import statements:

```markdown
## Asset Import Statements

### Icons
```typescript
import LogoIcon from '@/assets/icons/logo.svg';
import SearchIcon from '@/assets/icons/icon-search.svg';
```

### Images
```typescript
// For Next.js/React
import heroImage from '@/assets/images/hero-image.png';

// For public directory assets (no import needed)
// Use path: /assets/images/hero-image.png
```
```

#### Update Next Agent Input
Update the "Next Agent Input" section:

```markdown
## Next Agent Input

Ready for: Code Generator Agent
Input file: `docs/figma-reports/{file_key}-spec.md`
Assets downloaded: {count} files
Asset directory: `public/assets/`
```

## Output

Modify the Implementation Spec at: `docs/figma-reports/{file_key}-spec.md`

### Sections Added to Spec

```markdown
## Downloaded Assets

| Asset | Local Path | Size | Status |
|-------|------------|------|--------|
| {asset_name} | `{local_path}` | {file_size} | {OK/FAILED/WARN} |

## Asset Import Statements

### Icons
```typescript
// SVG icon imports
import {IconName} from '{path}';
```

### Images
```typescript
// Image imports (for bundled assets)
import {imageName} from '{path}';

// Public directory paths (no import needed)
// {asset_name}: {public_path}
```

## Asset Download Summary

- **Total assets:** {count}
- **Successfully downloaded:** {success_count}
- **Failed:** {failed_count}
- **Warnings:** {warn_count}
- **Download timestamp:** {YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}

## Next Agent Input

Ready for: Code Generator Agent
Input file: `docs/figma-reports/{file_key}-spec.md`
Assets downloaded: {count} files
Asset directory: `public/assets/`
```

## Rate Limits & Timeouts

- **Rate Limit (429):** Wait 30 seconds, retry with exponential backoff (30s, 60s, 120s)
- **Large Batch:** Process in batches of 5 assets to avoid timeouts
- **Download Timeout:** Set 60 second timeout per file using `curl --max-time 60`
- **MCP Timeout:** If MCP call takes > 30s, retry once before marking as failed
- **Concurrent Downloads:** Limit to 3 parallel downloads to avoid rate limiting

## Error Handling

**Reference:** `skills/figma-to-code/references/error-recovery.md`

### Download Recovery

```
For each asset:
1. Attempt download
2. If fails → Retry with backoff (3 attempts)
3. If still fails → Document failure
4. Continue with other assets
5. Report partial success
```

### Format Fallback

If requested format fails:

| Requested | Fallback |
|-----------|----------|
| SVG | PNG |
| WebP | PNG |
| PDF | PNG |

### Partial Success

Continue if:
- 80%+ assets downloaded
- All critical assets (logo, hero) present

Stop if:
- 0 assets downloaded
- All critical assets failed

### Download Fails
1. Log the failure with error message
2. Retry download once with same parameters
3. If retry fails:
   - Document failure in Downloaded Assets table with status "FAILED"
   - Add error details to Asset Download Summary
   - Continue with remaining assets

### Wrong Format Received
1. Log format mismatch warning
2. Re-export with explicit format parameter
3. If still wrong format:
   - Accept the file with warning
   - Document in Downloaded Assets table with status "WARN"
   - Note format discrepancy in summary

### Corrupt File Detected
1. Delete corrupt file
2. Re-download with fresh request
3. Validate again
4. If still corrupt:
   - Document failure in Downloaded Assets table
   - Add to failed count in summary

### Missing Node ID
1. Log error: "Asset '{name}' missing node ID"
2. Skip this asset
3. Document in Downloaded Assets table with status "FAILED - No Node ID"
4. Continue with remaining assets

### MCP Connection Issues
1. Wait 5 seconds
2. Retry the failed operation
3. If persistent failure:
   - Document all affected assets as failed
   - Provide instructions for manual download

### Directory Creation Fails
1. Check file system permissions for the project directory
2. Report error with specific path that failed
3. If cannot create required directories:
   - Abort asset download process
   - Document error: "Cannot create directory: {path} - Permission denied or invalid path"
   - Provide instructions for manual directory creation
4. Do not proceed with downloads until directories are available

### Spec Not Found
If `docs/figma-reports/{file_key}-spec.md` does not exist:
1. Report error: "Implementation Spec not found at expected path"
2. Check if `docs/figma-reports/` directory exists
3. List available specs using Glob: `docs/figma-reports/*-spec.md`
4. Provide instructions: "Run Design Analyst agent first to generate the spec"
5. Stop processing

### Spec Missing Assets Table
If the Implementation Spec has no "Assets Required" section:
1. Log warning: "No Assets Required table found in spec"
2. Add empty asset sections to spec
3. Update Next Agent Input section
4. Report: "No assets to download - spec updated for Code Generator"

## Validation Checklist

Before completing, verify:

- [ ] All assets from "Assets Required" table processed
- [ ] Files exist in correct directories (`public/assets/icons/`, `public/assets/images/`)
- [ ] Downloaded Assets table added to spec
- [ ] Asset Import Statements section added
- [ ] Asset Download Summary section added
- [ ] Next Agent Input updated for Code Generator Agent
- [ ] Failed assets documented with reasons
- [ ] Visual verification screenshot captured (optional)

### Visual Verification (Optional)

After organizing all assets, capture a verification screenshot of the original design for reference:

```
figma_get_screenshot:
  - file_key: {file_key}
  - node_ids: [{root_node_id}]
  - format: png
  - scale: 1
```

This screenshot serves as a visual reference for the Code Generator Agent to verify implementation accuracy.

## Guidelines

### File Naming
- Use **kebab-case** for all asset filenames
- Preserve original filename from spec when provided
- Add descriptive prefixes: `icon-`, `img-`, `bg-`
- Include resolution suffix for retina: `-2x`, `-3x`

### Directory Structure
```
project/
├── public/
│   └── assets/
│       ├── icons/          # SVG icons
│       │   ├── icon-search.svg
│       │   └── logo.svg
│       └── images/         # Raster images
│           ├── hero-image.png
│           └── avatar.webp
└── src/
    └── assets/             # Bundled assets (if needed)
        └── ...
```

### Import Path Conventions
- Use `@/` alias for src directory imports
- Use absolute paths `/assets/...` for public directory references
- Document both import styles in the spec

### Asset Optimization Notes
When documenting assets, include optimization recommendations:
- SVG: Note if icons should be inlined or used as components
- PNG: Note if WebP conversion recommended
- Large images: Note if lazy loading recommended
- Retina: Note if multiple resolutions needed
