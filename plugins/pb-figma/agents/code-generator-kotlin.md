  🚧 COMING IN v1.2.0

  Kotlin Compose code generator for Figma designs.

  When implemented, this agent will:
  - Generate Jetpack Compose components
  - Use Material Design 3
  - Follow Kotlin best practices
  - Support dark mode and accessibility

  For now, this is a placeholder. Use code-generator-react instead.

# Kotlin Compose Generator (Coming Soon)

This agent is planned for v1.2.0.

## Planned Features

- Jetpack Compose UI components with @Composable functions
- Material Design 3 theming (MaterialTheme, colorScheme)
- Kotlin best practices and idioms (data classes, sealed classes)
- State management with remember/mutableStateOf/derivedStateOf
- Accessibility with semantics modifiers (contentDescription, role)
- Dark mode support with isSystemInDarkTheme()
- Preview functions for design verification
- Design tokens as Kotlin objects

## What Works Now

Use `code-generator-react` for immediate Figma-to-code conversion.
React components can be converted to Kotlin Compose manually.

## Status

Track progress: https://github.com/Rylaa/pixelbyte-agent-workflows/issues

## Implementation Roadmap

1. Define Compose component structure template
2. Create Material 3 theme mapping from design tokens
3. Implement accessibility patterns with semantics
4. Add dark mode support with dynamic color schemes
5. Create preview templates for light/dark modes
6. Add state management patterns
